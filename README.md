# Darey.io Project output #MERN STACK

In this project, I built a flexible foundation for serving PHP websites and applications to one's visitors, using Nginx as web server and MySQL as database management system. I have uploaded screenshots of the results of several stages of the MERN installation.

My Project3 has an img subdir named images, see below.
