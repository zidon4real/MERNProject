# Darey.io Project output #MERNSTACK deployment

In this project #3 I  created a simple To-Do and deployed it to MERN stack. Also, I have written a frontend application using React.js that communicates with a backend application written using Expressjs. Lastly, I also created a Mongodb backend for storing tasks in a database.

My Project3 has an img subdir named images, see below.
